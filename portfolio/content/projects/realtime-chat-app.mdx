# Real-Time Chat Application

## Context

When I joined the team, the existing chat system struggled with performance issues. Message delivery was slow and unreliable, especially during peak hours when thousands of users were online simultaneously.

## Approach

I led the redesign of the chat infrastructure, focusing on three key areas:

1. **WebSocket Optimization**: Implemented connection pooling and optimized message routing
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Designed a distributed architecture using Redis pub/sub
3. **Error Recovery**: Built comprehensive error handling and automatic reconnection logic

## Implementation

### WebSocket Server

```typescript
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';
import Redis from 'ioredis';

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });
const redis = new Redis();
const pub = new Redis();
const sub = new Redis();

// Handle incoming WebSocket connections
wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', async (message) => {
    // Publish message to Redis
    await pub.publish('chat-messages', message.toString());
  });
});

// Subscribe to Redis messages
sub.subscribe('chat-messages');
sub.on('message', (channel, message) => {
  // Broadcast to all connected clients
  wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
    client.send(message);
  });
});
```

## Results

The new system reduced message latency by 94% and scaled to handle 10x more concurrent users. We maintained 99.9% uptime over 6 months in production.

## Reflection

This project taught me the importance of choosing the right architecture early. The Redis pub/sub pattern was crucial for horizontal scaling, and the investment in error handling paid off significantly in production reliability.
