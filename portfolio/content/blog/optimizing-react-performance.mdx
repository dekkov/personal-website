# Optimizing React Performance: A Practical Guide

Performance optimization is crucial for delivering great user experiences. In this guide, I'll share practical techniques for identifying and fixing performance issues in React applications.

## Identifying Bottlenecks

The first step is always measurement. Use React DevTools Profiler to identify slow components:

```typescript
import { Profiler } from 'react';

function onRenderCallback(
  id: string,
  phase: "mount" | "update",
  actualDuration: number
) {
  console.log(`${id} took ${actualDuration}ms to render`);
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Profiler id="App" onRender={onRenderCallback}>
      <YourComponent />
    </Profiler>
  );
}
```

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Memoization

Use `React.memo` for expensive components:

```typescript
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  // Expensive rendering logic
  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>;
});
```

### 2. useMemo for Expensive Calculations

```typescript
const sortedData = useMemo(() => {
  return data.sort((a, b) => a.value - b.value);
}, [data]);
```

### 3. Code Splitting

```typescript
const HeavyComponent = lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <HeavyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is an iterative process. Always measure before and after optimizations to ensure they're actually helping!
